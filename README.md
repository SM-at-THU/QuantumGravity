# QuantumGravity

This is a collection of notes and discussions at THU Physics about quantum gravity.

Go to [RefsAndSyllabus](https://github.com/SM-at-THU/QuantumGravity/tree/master/RefsAndSyllabus) for more information.

You can directly click on .md files to read it (which is written in Markdown syntax). For MD files with equations written in TeX, WTJiang recommend a Chrome extension [Github with Mathjax](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-with-mathjax/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima/related) to render them. You might need to refresh the page once.

## Using Github

1. Registrate your account
2. Tell a member your account name and you can be added to the group
3. Download the Github desktop app [here](https://desktop.github.com/)
4. Play with it:
 - Use the `+` sign around upperleft, then choose `Clone`, find SM-at-THU, and QuantumGravity, click `Clone QuantumGravity` and finally select a path to put the files (default directory recommended). Then you can see and edit files in that directory.
 - Main panel of the desktop app can display the local Changes you make and History of changes made by others (and you). You can select which to display from the tags `Changes/History`
 - If you've made some changes, you can use the `Commit to master` button to make sure of your changes. You need to type something in the Summary and description (description is optional).
 - `Sync` button around the upper right will syncronize your changes to the server so that you can see the web pages update.
 - It's highly recommended to sync first when you want to make any change.
